Michael Jun - Course 3 - Project Maze

Unity 5.5.1f1

Main Functionality: 
--  Assemble a maze scene using Unity primitives or custom models.
--  Populate the maze environment with waypoints, collectables, the key, a door, and a completion UI.

Key Functionality:
--  Player must collect two keys to "unlock" a door. I have placed one key in the first half of the maze and one in the second half.
--  Play a sound clip when either a coin or key is collected, waypoint clicked, or when door is locked/unlocked.
--  The player may collect coins (or lose coins).

Optional Additions:
--  There are two "hidden" waypoints that the player must find in order to complete the maze.
--  Trigger a lever for animation to expose "hidden" pathways.
--  Bonus/penalty coin chests.
